			<h3>:: The Beginnings of a Purpose?</h3>
				<p>When I speak to God, I find myself asking Him, "What would you have me do?". The answer, as I discern it, is always the same--"Help them; teach them".
				 I know in my <em>soul</em> that I'm meant for something important, something beneficial to this world, but never is that purpose clear.</p>
				<p>Perhaps now, however, I am beginning to understand.</p>
				<p>One thing I've always been rather sharp with is ferreting out FOSS(free/open-source alternatives) to popular software. What does this have to do with anything divine, you ask?
				As a child of a teacher and administrator in the school system, I've learned a great deal about the said system in general. There are many troubling things, many things to be desired, but
				perhaps now, within my immediate capacity to help, is the use aforementioned knowledge.</p>
				<p>The technology budget for schools can be quite hefty, and given the general monopoly that commercial software vendors have in every aspect of our digital lives, it's no surprise that
				schoolboard members assume that software is something they need pay ridiculous amounts for. Imagine how much money the average school could save if they were to replace, for instance, MS Office with
				a free or otherwise FOSS alternative, such as OpenOffice or Lotus Symphony. Imagine how much of that budget would be freed to be put to use on important projects to better the children's education.</p>
				<p>It's a bizarre way to interpret divine will, I know, but perhaps such a relatively small step is the catalyst that will unlock my potential; perhaps it is a stepping stone on the Path?</p>

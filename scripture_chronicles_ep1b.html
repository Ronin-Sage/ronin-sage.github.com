			<p>"In a planet this unimportant, there's always gonna be some fraghead makin' trouble just to entertain himself," he continued. "Lucky for us, none of them have been
			particularly dangerous and it's usually just a personal enemy that had the bounty placed anyway."</p>
			
			<p>"But this is a government contract--the first one in decades, I hear," interrupted Kryto. "This guy must be either someone really dangerous, really hated, or a bit of
			both," he added, though the speculation was unneeded. The fact that the planetary governor's office was stepping in spoke for itself, not to mention the notion that almost
			two dozen minutemen were willing to share a piece of the pie without fragging each other to hell over it was impressive in its own right.</p>
			
			<p>The men sat in silence for the next several minutes, the only sound being the increasingly irritating clicking and locking from Kryto's incessant fidgeting with his autogun.</p>
			
			<p>A sudden slowdown of the land-rover brought them all to attention.</p>
			
			<p>"What in the...are we at the waypoint? It should've been at least 15 more minutes until we hit it," the man sitting opposite of Kryto stated, a slight note of urgency
			in his tone.</p>
			
			<p>"Relax, kid. It's probably just a motor malfunction or some such. Driver--what's going on out there?" Now it was the older man who spoke as he banged on the cabin door.</p>
			
			<p>A second or two passed until the hatch leading to the driver's area opened up, a woman in her 40s, Kryto guessed, appearing.</p>
			
			<p>"We're getting some odd vox interference...the rovers can hear each other fine, but there's a thin layer of static now that definitely isn't normal, so we're preceeding with
			caution..." she trailed off mid-sentence, peering down at the vox panel as if something just caught her attention. "Hold on a sec'...well what the hell...'been a decade since I've
			had my vox channels hacked. Of course there was this one time at the siege of Vand Kamp..."</p>
			
			<p>The men in the passenger hold turned their collective attention to her.</p>
			
			<p>"Hacked?" the man adjacent to Kryto asked.</p>
			
			<p>The driver scowled at the man, apprently annoyed at being interrupted, and switched the passenger hold's vox speaker on.</p>
			
			<p>"...I'm giving you a clear warning...leave this area and no harm will come to you...this is your last warning..." a deep and dead-serious voice stated before the vox channels went
			once again blank with silence.</p>
			<p>"Who the hell is that?" several men seemed to ask all at once.</p>
			
			<p>The driver just shrugged in response. "It's like this with the other two rovers as well, which is odd, because there's a good bit of space between us and we're on separate, isolated
			channels by default, only communicating with each other. Yet, they're all reporting to hear it with apparent clarity and on all channels." she turned to face the bounty-hunters, a grin suddenly on her dusty face. "They didn't say we
			were going after a rogue coghead, eh?" the grin widened as she spoke, but faded as the half-joke died out. "Well anyway, we're converging on the secondary waypoint as a precaution. No
			one really knows what took out the initial group of guys, so we're assuming we're dealing with a small group of rebels here...whoo-boy! Just like the old times!"</p>
			
			<p>Once again, her good humor was lost on the men. She was an ex-dropship pilot who found work as a rover-driver with bounty offices as a little bit of "entertainment". Dropship pilots, by
			their very nature, are all borderline-insane, in Kryto's experiences, so it was no surprise she seemed to enjoy the prospect of driving straight into presumably hostile territory with
			little or no information on what the hell they were up against.</p>
			
			<p>As the rover drifted northbound to meet with the others, Kryto couldn't shake the feeling that they were being herded.</p>
			
			<p class="sep">II</p>
			
			<p>Had it not been for these intruders, he might have been having a good day.</p>
			
			<p>The sky was filled with crude, but pleasing brushstrokes of cloud formations and the weather was warm and dry, but now this was irrelevant.</p>
			
			<p>He breathed a short sigh through the facemask that came up just below eye-level and spied the approaching group of vehicles with a mixture of nonchalance and a slight sadness. The
			loner bore no hatred against them, but as an enemy of the state, they would hunt him and he would have no choice but to fight back. They were pawns who, had they known what enemy awaited
			them, probably would have turned tail at first opportunity, but such a notion was now just a nagging reminder of what he had to do.</p>
			
			<p>With that, he pressed a button on the small device produced from a belt pocket and continued to watch the rovers as he sat crouched near the outcrop of the small canyon.</p>
			
			<p class="sep">II</p>
			
			<p>The makeshift convoy was proceeding without any trouble underneath a socket-shaped canyon when, without warning, several small explosions erupted around them and the men were jerked
			in their seats with the sudden jolt. Peeking cautiously through the viewing port of the makeshift APC, Kryto could see that the same occurred with the other two rovers. Impossibly, he
			thought, the detonations dealt no physical damage as far he could tell, and the only sign that anything had happened at all was the dust settling from the sudden stop of the land-rovers'
			treads. Yet somehow, the vehicles were stopped dead in their tracks.</p>

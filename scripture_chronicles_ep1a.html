                <h3>:: The Ronin-Sage Chronicles ::</h3>
			    <p>This is, summarily, a WiP short-story series centered around a fictional character of mine in the Warhammer 40k universe. Details
			    and organization are to follow in near-future, so for now, just enjoy the first episode.</p>
			    <br/>

			    <div class="literature">
					<p>As a matter of principle, Kryto Rykard disdained anything that didn't involve instant gratification, the
					satisfaction of personal vengeance, or some vain physical indulgence, so it was no suprise that he found himself
					disliking this day more and more. He sighed audibly, checking and re-checking the chamber of his autogun for the eleventh-straight time 
					in the back of the civilian land-rover, now converted into a light APC.</p>
					<p>He was a minuteman, though more commonly classified as a merc(but doesn't minuteman sound more appealing?),
					taking on whatever job needed doing on the small, remote world of Verex IV. It was a brown orb of monotony in a remote star-system where you 
					were more likely to die of old age than be killed doing something interesting--and that's saying something in this galaxy. Those unfortunate enough 
					to find themselves in this realm were either dust-farmers, struggling to fertilize soil that refused to nurture anything except false hope, or 
					fugitives lucky enough to have jumped ship en route to another system, or some other miscellaneous nobody. Then of course, there was the Adeptus Mechanicus,
					which had all but abandoned its attempts to find and extract yttrium ore from the planet, leaving its outpost manned with dusty servitors and even dustier adepts.</p>
					<p>Kryto ejected the magazine from his weapon just as he did the recurring thought, half-consciously checking the integrity of the mechanical component.</p>
					<p>"If there was a malfunction to be found, you would've caught it in the fifth or sixth time around, I would imagine,"a voice next to him remarked dryly.</p>
					<p>The voice belonged to another minuteman whos name Kryto hadn't bothered to learn -- a gruff, lean fellow who, like him, worked as everything from a grox-rustler
					to a bodyguard for the local artistocracy.</p>
					<p>"Why do you suppose the bigheads offering this bounty wanted us to drive Emperor-knows-where just to choke on some dust on the way there?" the man asked,
					not even bothering to open his eyes as he sat reclined near the rover's vent-shaft.</p>
					<p>"Hell if I know or care. I just wanna find the grox-humpin' bastard, frag 'em, collect the damned bounty, and call it a day. Speakin' of which...why do you suppose
					they gave us so little on a such large bounty, anyway?"</p>
					<p>The man just shrugged apologetically.</p>
					<p>It was a question on the minds of the other four men as well. When word got out around that there was a bounty thrice as large as any that had ever been posted in
					recent years, every grox-hugger and his mother showed up with a lasgun and a rehearsed mug, claiming to be a top-notch bounty-hunter interested in the assignment.
					This rover was just one of several lookin' for whoever the hell had pissed somebody off enough to get a bounty on their head.</p>
					<p>As if something just dawned on him, he sat upright just then, a look of mock suspicion forming on his unkempt face to garner attention from the others.</p>
					<p>"Rumor has it they sent out a dozen or so hunters after this guy the other day in the same dust bowl area we're in now. So-say, none of 'em were heard from again,
					so they bumped up the bounty to bring more warm bodies in the hunt." Kryto revealed in an almost hushed tone, relishing the thought of having some advantage over the
					others, no matter how trivial.</p>
					<p>The men exchanged nervous glancing at each other, and Kryto fought to keep a grin from forming on his oily face.</p>
					<p>"Bull," declared the man next to Kryto. The others turned to regard him. "It's probably the same as always, some nameless fool screwed a noble's wife or stole from
					him or some such and now someone wants his balls on a platter."</p>
					<p>"Of course it's the same as always." The man next to speak was an older fellow with a cheap excuse for an overcoat and possibly even cheaper lasgun, the barel of the
					weapon resting against his gnarled face. He was the lead bounty hunter of the group. "The way I see it, we minutemen are the only reason this planet even stays somewhat
					civil. The Arbites have been underpowered and underfunded ever since the end of the last aristoracy dispute some 40 years ago."</p>
					<p>He'd find no argument there. The Adeptus Arbites, like any organization of the Imperium, had a strong link to the state of the world on which it existed. Some planets
					had precincts tough enough to withstand a Tyranid incursion(literally, as had been the case with some), while less populated and less important planets had civil defense
					forces whos power existed almost solely in name.</p>

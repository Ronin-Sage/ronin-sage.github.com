			<h3>"Modificiatus" -- July 11, 2010</h3>

			<p>So I've started up modding Dawn of War. Again.</p>

			<p>I'd been playing around with a "personal"(ie, unreleased) mod of mine for a while, but the "project" itself never
			really took off. With no one to actually play the game with, and with little desire to release the mod to ever-shrinking
			DoW modding community, I couldn't really see a reason for putting the work in.</p>

			<p>Not that any of that's changed, of course, but I find myself being perepetually bored-to-death these days and
			figured this could be a bit of a remedy.</p>

			<p>This time, however, I'm doing things a bit more clinically. I'm sticking to modding only the LUAs, which has the
			benefit of allowing for inheritance-based modding as well as git-friendliness. I mean sure, I could keep all of the
			modified RGDs in my git tree, but being binary files, there's no way to tell exactly what changed from file version
			to file verison.</p>

			<p>Setting up git for Windows wasn't as difficult as I thought it'd be, and a Cygwin installation later, I'm on my way
			to turning this into a releasable project.</p>

			<h3>"Dakka" -- April 24, 2010</h3>
			
			<p>Tonight, as it always seems to be with Saturdays, I found myself suddenly edgy for no particular reason, the kind 
			of random restlessness that eventually puts you in a deep, dark well of despair and provokes fits of anger. So I did the only 
			sensible thing a person in my position could do:</p>
			
			<p>I went out and bought a gun.</p>
			
			<p>But let's backtrack a bit. You know that feeling you get sometimes, a piercing sense of 
			loneliness that can only be quelled by commandeering the nearest mode of transport and riding the wind until you
			find that nameless, fleeting thing you've been searching for? Of course you don't, because you, my dear reader, 
			are presumably sane.</p>
			
			<p>In any case, manifest itself this daemon of a feeling did, and this time, I chose bring to a weapon to bear that 
			rarely leaves the rack these days: social exposure.</p>
			
			<p>There's a certain logic inherent in the act of thrusting oneself in the midst of other sentient(or at least breathing)
			organisms, in hopes that maybe some of that love-of-life stuff will somehow rub off onto you. Who knows, maybe it's
			airborne, and by exposing oneself, one can contract whatever disease keeps the 20-somethings of this
			city flocking to bars and social spots like fruit flies to a picnic.</p>
			
			<p><em>What the hell</em>, I thought. Mocha sounded good right about then, so a medium mocha at a nearby coffee joint it
			was. Maybe I could meet new people, preferably of the single and attractive female kind in this place. Or, deviousness willing, 
			place a well-construed trap wrought of an eye-candy Compiz desktop or the mysterious, endless walls of tech-runes of
			kernel compilation and use it as a conversation-starter.</p>
			
			<p>And I would have gotten away with it, too, if weren't for the temperature of the mocha I ordered making me sweat uncomfortably
			and causing my nose to run a bit.</p>
			
			<p>Not as planned.</p>
			
			<p><em>Alright, screw it</em>. Plan B. And by 'Plan B' I mean sudden and random improv(my speciality). I did what I normally do
			when I'm in an 'iffy' mood: summon Arcus and ride around at faster-than-normal speeds with the window down listening to my
			'Syngel' playlist.</p>
			
			<p>Next, the other special thing such a mood requires--buy random crap. Spend hard-earned cash like a madman on
			items you have no business buying and have zero immediate or near-future use for.</p>
			
			<p>20 minutes and 50 bucks later, I had an interesting airgun kit with holster, safety-glasses, ammo pouch, and target-sheets included.</p>
			
			<p>Maybe tomorrow will bring a chippier mood, you know, after I find a suitable target practice area. In any case, I, how-you-say, got dakka, yes?</p>

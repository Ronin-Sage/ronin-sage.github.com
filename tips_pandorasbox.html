    <h3>:: Opening Pandora's Box -- Delving into Openbox ::</h3>
	  
	   <h4>[Introduction]</h4>
			
			<p>As a user of <a href="http://lxde.org">LXDE(Lightweight X11 Desktop)</a>, I had already been accustomed to using and configuring Openbox, which it
			uses as its adopted window manager, so it wasn't much of a thing for me to switch to using stand-alone OpenBox. If you're wondering, I switched mainly
			because of the general lack of maturity I felt from its components(namely LXPanel and LXTask).</p>
			
			<p>Note that this is <em>*NOT*</em> a complete how-to on setting up Openbox, just a brief overview of some useful things I did that I felt other users 
			might benefit from knowing. With that said, some common file locations:</p>
			
			<p><b>Autostart: </b><code>~/.config/openbox/autostart.sh</code></p>
			<p><b>General: </b><code>~/.config/openbox/rc.xml</code></p>
			<p><b>Root-menu: </b><code>~/.config/openbox/menu.xml</code></p>
			
			<p>For those [somewhow] unfamiliar, Openbox is minimal and sharply-quick window manager(WM) for X, originally being based on Blackbox but now rewritten. Probably its
			most distinguishing feature(or at least most immediately recognizable) is the "root menu" that opens up upon right-clicking the desktop.</p>
			
			<p>Openbox is a <em>window manager</em>, that is to say, it's merely a program that controls the drawing/placement of windows and provides some basic
			necessities for desktop usage(this differs from a <em>desktop environment</em>, like Gnome or KDE, in that it is stand-alone component and only manages
			the windowing aspect the desktop and mostly leaves out other "fluffy" aspects.</p>
			
			<h4>[Wallpaper]</h4>
			
			    <img align="right" style="margin-right:15px" src="lib/ob_1.png" alt="screenie 1" />
			
			    <p>What you'll probably want to do first(okay, "want", not "need") is setup a wallpaper. Personally, I use <a href="http://projects.l3ib.org/nitrogen/">Nitrogen</a>. 
			    Once installed, it's just a matter of running:</p>
			    
			    <p><code>nitrogen ~/Pictures</code>(or whereever your image directory is located)</p>
			    
			    <p>Double-click an entry to preview it, and click "Apply" to save your configuration. If you want to preserve this wallpaper to always show up when you start Openbox, add
			    this to your autostart.sh:</p>
			    
			    <p><code>nitrogen --restore &amp;</code></p>
			    
			    <p>This effectively has Nitrogen restore the preserved wallpaper and run in the background.</p>
			
			<br/>
			<h4>[Root-menu]</h4>
			
			    <p>You pretty much have two options when it comes to configuring the "root menu" or right-click menu featured in Openbox--you can opt
			    for the "manual" approach of editing your <em>rc.xml</em> by hand, or you can use <a href="http://obmenu.sourceforge.net/">obmenu</a> as a GUI alternative.</p>
			    
			    <p>Using obmenu would be as simple as running it and making sure you first open the right file by clicking the Open button, then navigating to [typically] ~/.config/openbox/rc.xml.</p>
			    
			    <p>Its interface is pretty much self-explanatory, but if you run into any trouble, you can consult the documentation <a href="http://obmenu.sourceforge.net/doc.html">here</a>.</p>
			    
			     <img src="lib/ob_2.png" style="margin:15px" alt="screenie 2" />
			     
			<h4>Panel</h4>
			
			<p>The final step you'll need to take to make your Openbox desktop fully-functional, IMO, is adding a panel. There are a number of popular apps out there, but I find that 
			<a href="http://pypanel.sourceforge.net/">pypanel</a> goes extremely well with my Openbox setup.</p>
			
			<p>The first thing you'll want to take a look at in regard to this program is it's configuration file, located at <em>~/.pypanelrc</em> Configuration is extremely
			straight-forward, but if you want a nice-looking setup to play around with immediately, here's mine:</p>
			
			<p><a href="pypanelrc">[my .pypanelrc]</a> (Place in your home(~/) directory -- DON'T FORGET THE '.')</p>
			
			<h4>Final Product</h4>
			
			<p>The end-result, with my <a href="pypanelrc">pypanelrc</a> file, should be something like this: </p>

			</a>
			
			<p>Obviously, you can tweak everything to your personal needs and preferences, but this setup should provide a nice foundation to build upon.</p>

			<!-- <p>Configuring Openbox is a farily geekish affair(but what Linux-related thing isn't?)-\-it doesn't use a settings daemon like "Gnome Control Center",
			so what you have to do is edit some XML files to get the desktop you want. In my case, these files are <em>~/.config/openbox/rc.xml</em>(WM config) and
			<em>~/.config/openbox/menu.xml</em>("root menu" entries and config), but more on these later.</p> -->

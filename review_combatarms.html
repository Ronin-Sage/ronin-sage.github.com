          <h3>:: Combat Arms Review ::</h3>
		
		<p>Combat Arms is a relatively new game on the American/Oceanian market. It's a MMO published by Nexon Inc.(same guys that hold publishing rights for
		MapleStory, Mabinogi in that market) with a focus on fast-paced, somewhat realistic fps action complimented by character/weapon customization.</p>

			<p class="comment">A bit on the chunky side, eh?</p>
		</div>
		
		<h4>Graphics</h4>
		
		<p>The first thing you notice about CA(Combat Arms) is its graphical detail. Even on a lightweight Intel 945GM laptop and with super-low/tweaked settings, it
		still looks and feels like a retail game. Weapon models are the best I've seen since Counter-Strike: Source and from what I can see with my low settings, effects
		are quite sharp as well. One thing I do <em>not</em> like in regard to graphics, however: character models. Yes, they're quite detailed, but damn if I can't
		get past their "chunkiness". I understand these are mercs outfitted with a good bit of equipment, but the midsection on these guys(and gals) in particular
		is enough to make Rosie O'Donnell appreciate her physique. It's a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things, but it's something that *still* irks me to this day.</p>
		
		<p>On a more positive note, terrain and textures in levels are probably the most detailed you'll find in any f2p shooter. Period. The game's based on the same engine family as <i>F.E.A.R.</i>(Jupiter engine), but with an update, to my knowledge.</p>
		
		<h4>Sound</h4>
		
		<p>The game's sounds are overall a less impressive ordeal. Characters' pre-defined exclamations are of the same quality you've come to expect from a shooter; nothing special here. Weapons sounds are a more complex story.
		On one hand, you have the deep, intimidating report of a FAMAS assault rifle or the subtle "twp-twp" sound of a sileneced SR-25 sniper-rifle; on the other hand, some of the guns in the game fire and reload with sounds
		you'd expect to come from a plastic toy, not a service rifle. The Daewoo K2 and M16A3 in particular have a rather hollow, artificial tone to them. Granted, it's nothing that breaks the game, but it does leave a bit to be desired.</p>
		
		<h4>Gameplay</h4>
		
		<p>Ah, the meat of any shooter game.</p>
		
		<p>Gameplay in CA is fast-paced, but realistic enough to keep the whole modern-day merc scheme believable without injecting too much insanity in the mix. To put that in perspective, it's less realistic than the likes of Counter-Strike/CS:S 
		or Call of Duty 4, but more realistic than UrbanTerror or most Quake3 derivatives.</p>
		
		<p>You have your basic WASD movement, jump, and sprint(limited by time-usage; recharges) scheme, so fps veterans should feel right at home here. I mentioned it being "fast-paced" because there's no
		leaning mechanic or acceleration factor to "hinder" you, keeping you somewhat on-edge. Weapons are drawn, by default, by the press of a numeric key and there's also a bindeable "previous weapon" key, but one should note
		the strange absence of a "next weapon" key to accompany this. Still, it's relatively straight-forward in that you press, for instance, 1 to switch to your primary weapon(slot 1), while pressing it again to
		switch to the [other] primary weapon on slot 1(sort of like switching from 1a to 1b). This might turn off those who are used to one weapon per keybind, but it's no big deal to adapt to it.</p>
		
		<p>You have a slew of modern-day weapons at your disposal. M16 fans may want to brace themselves for a huge dissappointment, as the M16A3(your default primary weapon) is considerably ineffective compared to nearly
		any given weapon in any given area. That's not to say it's totoally useless, but you can't help but feel like it's a huge handicap to your performance.</p>
		
		<p>Of course, you're free to purchase any number of weapons from the game's armory, which uses your standard f2p shooter "shop", where you buy weapons with GP(game currency earned after matches). Combat Arms does
		an extremely good job of providing an unprecedented number of weapons that, for the most part, seem true to the attributes of their real-life counter-parts. Players can use the infamous AK-47, MP5, and other weapons,
		including the L96A1 sniper rifle(related to the AWP, for you Counter-Strike fans out there), K2, FAMAS, M1911 pistol, and even the LAW missile launcher. There's assault rifles, carbines, SMGs, shotguns, pistols, some
		rather exotic melee weapons(military-issue shovel and kukri, for example) and secondary items like the incendiary grenade and nerve gas. The key feature that should be noted is the ability to attach silencers, extended magazines, and
		different scopes to your weapons.</p>

		</div>
		
		<p>Additionally, you can buy some gear for your merc, outfitting him/her with a protective helmet, mask, different body armor and aesthetic options such as
		different camo styles and even a beanie or shades. Speaking of gear, most of the stuff in-game in bought with GP, but like any f2p game, there's the option
		to pay real cash to get NX points to purchase stuff from the "Black Market"(cash shop). It retains balance by offering mostly aesthetically-enhanced versions
		of weapons(black-painted SCAR-L or gold-plated AK-47) and other gear and perks(colored-name, anyone?).</p>
		
		<p>Matches are organized in pub/lobby format, where you pick a server/channel and either create or a join a user-created game. There's your standard fps game modes, including
		One Man Army(deathmatch), capture-the-flag, search &amp; destroy(think Counter-Strike's CT vs. T), and others. Maps range in scale from the compressed-size, in-yo-face arena of Junk Flea
		to the large-scale snipefest of Snow Valley; the chaos is what keeps it fresh.</p>
		
		<p>But speaking of chaos, Combat Arms is hands-down one of the most often-exploited games I've played, and although the bimonthly patches help, you'll notice
		the not-so-rare hack-user ruining your game. Some technical issues keep this from getting a higher rating as well -- there's the ridiculously annoying issue of "bullet-lag", where it takes a split second longer than usual for the server
		to register shots on another player(sometimes, it doesn't register at all), as well as the ocassional "jamming" of the gun during performance-hits. The latter is mostly a low-end machine problem,
		but I suspect there's some inefficiently-coded part of the game that is particularly difficult for lower-end machines to trudge through. These issues don't <em>completely</em> ruin
		the game, but at times you'll be convinced they do. Patches come often weeks after glitches and hacks are exploited to the max and some issues remain unresovled for weeks, even months
		at a time.</p>
		
		<p>On the plus side, Combat Arms is excellent when it comes to gameplay-feedback(trust me, it's a feature more noteworthy than it sounds). There's a distinct "whomp" sound to let you know you've got a kill, followed by a zoomed-in
		text of your kill number appearing on-screen. You can also get more distinct rewards, such as multi-kills and above. Moreover, the server stores all of your stats--including weapon
		accuracy and headshots--so you can check the website for your detailed record and compare your stats to others.</p>
		
		<p>As dismal as those drawbacks may sound, Combat Arms can still be an enjoyable game, if you give it a chance. It's definitely worth the download, and every budget fps player should
		have this game on their harddrive.</p>

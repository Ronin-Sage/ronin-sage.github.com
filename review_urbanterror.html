	<h3>:: Urban Terror ::</h3>
	
	<p>Urban Terror("UrT") is a cross-platform psuedo-realism FPS that is simple enough to enjoy, but featureful enough to love. 
	The game itself runs on its own ioUrbanTerror engine(with closed-source content), a modification of the ioquake3 engine(which 
	is effectively an open-sourced implementation of the original Quake 3 engine).</p>
	
	<h4>Graphics</h4>
	
	<p>Graphics here are nothing particularly special, as you have to remember this is a game running on an 
	improved version of the considerably aged Quake 3 engine. That's not to say it's ugly, but aesthetics aren't
	what make this game so great.</p>
	
	<p>On the bright side, being based on such an engine gives the game inherently low system requirements and cross-platform support,
	facts that speak for themselves when it comes to reaching a wide audience.</p>
	
	<p>One thing that you have the give the designers props for is the support of built-in "accessories" for your player-model ingame, commonly
	known as "funstuff". These items range from pirate hats to goggles, to "ninja-masks". Granted, they have nil effect on gameplay, but are still
	an interesting way to make your character stand out. Other that, you can choose from one of eight player models(4 male, 4 female); notably, every
	item you have equipped is displayed on your model, including primary weapons strapped to your back.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Sound</h4>
	
	<p>Weapon sounds are relatively unrealistic, or at least mundane in nature(the "PKEW-PKEW" of a Desert Eagle, for example); similarly unimpressive, 
	you get some so-so vocal effects of "ARGH!" and such when you receive damage.</p>
	
	<p>Pre-recored radio messages are here as well, and you get some generic status-report quirps and comical "wtf, over?" chatter-binds available.</p>
	
	<h4>Gameplay</h4>
	
	<p>This is what truly makes this game fun to play and what justifies the score I gave it.</p>
	
	<p>Gameplay is paced at a level of "pseudo-realism", that is to say, slightly less "realistic" than something like Counter-Strike, but noticeably more
	realistic than your typical strafe-jump-fest aracde-realism shooter. Acrobatics are present here, mind you, but in a more refined form: you can dash, wall-jump,
	climb over flat surfaces, and even "power-slide"(moving at a high speed, jumping, and using a crouched position to "slide" across the ground). All of these
	feats consume their own amount of stamina points, the pool of which recovers over time(the maximum amount is affected by the presence of body armor, it should be noted).</p>
	
	<p>Players have access to a gear-configuraton GUI that opens when entering a server(though it can be called up at any time thereafter)--something along the lines
	of the original Counter-Strike's, but a bit "smarter". You choose your primary weapon(M4, AK-103, PSG-1, etc.), secondary weapon(typically sub-machine guns or shotguns, but these can be used as primaries),
	sidearm, knife(currently just one, with two methods of attack). Additionally, you can equip accessories like the ammo-pack(grants 2x ammo), laser-sight, med-pack, and others. Logically, you only equip one item to each "slot", each one
	governed by a sort of "weight" system(for example, you can't equip a LMG, shotgun, pistol, grenades, *and* a med-pack).</p>
	
	<p>Damage in the game is kept somewhat realistic--a couple of well-placed shots will kill you, here, though you have access to kevlar vests and helmets. Head-shots are obviously fatal if you're not wearing a helmet(if you are, it takes two to kill you);
	torso shots are more damaging than arm wounds and so-on. Wounds to the lower body that go uncared for actually force you to limp(or rather "walk") around, reducing your mobility considerably, but this and blood-loss resulting from wounds can be stopped by
	applying a bandage to yourself(you can also patch your teammates up), the application potency of which is enhanced by equipping a med-pack. Additionally, damage results in "stamina degredation"(reduction of max stamina), so a player on their last "polygon" of health can barely jump, let alone dash or wall-jump.</p>
	
	<p>Weapons fire realistically enough, with idle-crouching and controlled bursts yielding the least spread, though most weapons have a number of firing-modes(single-fire, burst, full-auto, for instance).</p>
	
	<p>For the most part, the maps are of the psuedo-realism you encounter in games like Counter-Strike(odd, I find myself referencing that game a lot in this review...) and gameplay modes include deathmatch, team deathmatch, CTF, bomb, and survivor.</p>
	
	<p>If you're on a lower-end system like myself, you owe it to yourself to try this free, cross-platform shooter, but generally, anyone who's into first-person shooters can find something to like about this game.</p>

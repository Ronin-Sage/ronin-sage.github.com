					<p>"Driver, what the hell are you doing? Get us somewhere <em>other</em> than here, maybe?!" Kryto exclaimed.</p>
					<p>"I would your Awesomeness, but every damned system on this junkheap just got fragged by an EMP of some sort. Navigation, communication, steering, all of it. We'd be lucky to get the
					horn to work at this point." With that, she pluckd an auspex from the roof of the cabin and started spouting curses at an impressive rate at the inanimate devices before her.</p>
					<p>"Alright, pussies! Time to hunt us some rebels! We're on foot from here on out, so eyes sharp--I wouldn't want to have to loot any of your bodies," the lead merc bellowed, suddenly energetic
					and grinning, as if commanding schola children to recess. Of course, they all knew the part about looting their bodies was on partially a joke.</p>
					<p>"Are you kidding me? We'd be target practice out there!" one man shouted. "I say we camp our asses here and--"</p>
					<p>Quicker than Kryto thought a man at that age could move, the leader silenced the man with a swift blow to the chest, knocking the air out of him.</p>
					<p>"Anyone else got any objections? We're sitting ducks in here, canned grub if you will, so why not spread outside and get a perimeter going? 'sides, in
					here we're all one target, but out there, there's a good chance the guy next to you will get shot first, am I right?" he laughed.</p>
					<p>Again, this was only <em>partially</em> a joke.</p>
					<p>The driver produced an autopistol from somewhere within the cabin, pulled a latch to open the rear-gate, and motioned for the men to move out.</p>
					<p>The others in the nearby rovers were doing the same, Kryto saw, and as he nervously scanned the ridgeline ahead, he thought he heard a sound--something
					like a rock cracking a window.</p>
					<p>To his horror, he looked around to see one of the guys from the APCs drop like a ragdoll, a hole pierced through his skull and out the back so cleanly
					it took a moment for the blood and brain matter to spill out.</p>
					<p>"Sniper!" someone yelled.</p>
					<p><em>Sniper, what the hell?</em> Kryto thought to himself. This was a bad place for a vehicular breakdown, that's for sure, but the area wasn't so wide that
					a guy with a longlas or some such weapon could fire confidently in these quarters--it would be suicide. The vehicles were downed about 20 feet from each other
					in an area enclosed such that any fighting would have to be within carbine range, and even that was stretching it.</p>
					<p>The man who had been crouching next to Kryto against the rover crumbled to the ground suddenly, blood beginning to pour from a gaping hole in his neck. He died almost instantly, as
					the round must've pierced straight through his spinal cord.</p>
					<p>These were bounty-hunters, self-serving scoundrels and opportunists, so it was no surprise that most of them figured the bounty wasn't worth it and ran off in random directions, only
					to be knocked off their feet with a shot through the skull or a round to the heart.</p>
					<p>Mercs were dying all around. There must have been at least a dozen shooters, but where were they? The only real sniping positoins were at the direct front and rear of the path, because
					there were only dustleaf trees for cover in-between, and even they were sparsely located.</p>
					<p>"This is bullcrap, I didn't sign up for--" the driver's exclamation was cut short as a round impacted like an invisible javelin through her forehead, silencing her forever.</p>
					<p>Fighting the psychological urge to freeze-up, Kryto forced himself to dive into a small crevice for cover, his autogun grip moist with sweat. At least 10 hunters were down now, all of
					them the ones with the larger caliber las and auto weapons.</p>
					<p>Whoever these guys were, they were efficient.</p>
					<p class="sep">II</p>
					<p>Another one of the bounty-hunters was turned into a cloud of gore above the sight of his long-barreled pistol, and the renegade dashed off once again, moving with impossible speed from
					cover-to-cover amidst the stout trees, his EMP bombs having forced the mercs on foot where their APCs counted for nothing.</p>
					<p>Another individual, this one a scarred woman in her twenties, had her skull ruptured by a silent shot from his heavily modified pistol. The death was gruesome, but mercifully quick.</p>
					<p>The plan faded quickly when the other hunters, some dozen remaining, caught on to his manuevers and began to fire at their target.</p>
					<p>The mercs began to regroup, using the advantage of their numbers, so he holstered his handgun to his belt and drew an elegant, slender, double-edged blade of medium-length from the
					scabbard on his back.</p>
					<p>He would have to fight it out at melee-range from this point, where their numbers counted for nothing and his superior skill and inhuman physical attributes counted for everything.</p>
					<p>Moving with predatory agility, he surprised the next bounty-hunter he came across. Crouched against a downed rover for cover, the man opened fire in time to miss as his attacker vaulted clean
					over him, lopping off his head before landing with impossible grace and becoming mobile once again.</p>
					<p>The next target was slightly more forunate. The merc had managed to draw his lasgun just in time to fire it, but from the time it took him to begin pulling the trigger to the end of the slight
					manuever, his target had side-stepped some full fourteen inches to the right.</p>
					<p>The renegade flashed forwards, moving so quickly that his assailant seemed to react in slow-motion, and thrust his palm forward with such force that it instantly collapsed the surprised man's
					lungs and sent him flying back into a canyon wall, his backbones breaking enough to finish the kill.</p>
					<p>Regrouped, the other bounty-hunters began to establish a flank, all crouched cautiously behind a ridgeline, firing their collective weapons in a storm of lasbolts and solid munitions.</p>
					<p>Those unfortunate enough to have been the volley's target were cut to pieces where they stood, but the renegade himself was nowhere to be seen. In truth, he had somehow cleared the eight yards
					between he and his enemies, side-dashing repeatedly to avoid the sporadic fire. He moved with such inhuman precision that he seemed to glide across the surface of the terrain.</p>
					<p>"Hold tight! Gun that bastard down where he stands!" he heard one of the bounty-hunters say, an older man with a shoddy, patched coat and rugged lasgun.</p>
					<p>He defied the apparent leader of the group with a maneuver that should have been impossible. He leapt a height taller than two men, kicking off the rocky surface of the canyon to alter his direction.
					In mid-air and upside-down, he produced several disc-shaped objects that began to glow a dangerous green hue and launched them in the direction of the undisciplined flank.</p>
					<p>These detonations were no mere EMPs. Armor was seared and flesh varpoized as the odd, fist-width discs exploded in a brilliant burst of kinetic energy. Still soaring thrugh the air, he once again drew
					his pistol to land at a crouch, eliminating two then three targets codly before holstering the weapon.</p>
					<p class="sep">II</p>
					<p>Kryto Rykard was stunned--whether from the explosion or the onslaught of this apparently metahuman foe, he couldn't tell. All he could do was watch as the figure dashed from fallen merc to fallen merc, stabbing
					hearts and shooting dying men through the skull without hesitation or pause. It was mercy-killing, he knew, but that didn't do much to shake the utterly crushing fear the he felt now. He was no soldier, not that
					it would've made much of a difference against this guy, he thought bitterly.</p>
					<p>He tried to move, but more than fear kept him pinned. He looked down to see that his lower legs were a mess of vaporized blood and bone matter, but strangely he felt no pain, which was very bad.</p>
					<p>Pain meant you were still alive.</p>
					<p>All of the other teams of bounty-hunters, a full 19 men and women, lay in assorted piecs of cleanly-cut body parts and lumps of electrocuted flesh underneath the cavernous overhang. As the warrior finished dispatching
					another downed bounty-hunter, all Kryto felt was uncontrollable fear mixed with the bitter sting of defeat.</p>
					<p>The renegade they had been sent to hunt ended up hunting them and now he was going to die here. They should have heeded his warnings, but hell, who could've known? no gig was worth this, of that much he was sure.</p>
					<p>These thoughts were broken by a piercing fear as Kryto realized the rogue was suddenly standing over him.</p>
					<p>"Oh frag..." was all he could say. It was then that he could see the warrior for the first time up-close.</p>
					<p>He was young, barely into his twenties, and looked human enough. He had a tall and slender build with compact, but sharpened muscles. Drapes of cloth and apparently heavily modded body armor that veiled his form only
					added to mystery.</p>
					<p>The face was normal enough--dark brown skin wtih a slightly red hue was exposed above what looked to be a faceguard that stopped just above the nose...but then he noticed the eyes.</p>
					<p>Where normal human eyes would have contained a white cornea with a colored pupil, his were something altogether alien. Shaped normally, but with pitch-black cornea and fierce, unnatural green pupils that seemed to glow
					with power, his visage was startling, to say the least.</p>
					<p>The last thing Kryto Rykard saw was an almost apologetic gaze of regret as the renegade brought his blade down in a sharp, precise manner to pierce his heart.</p>
					<p>Cleaning his blade with a deft swing, the rogue sheathed it back into into its scabbard and, his regretful business concluded, he bowed his head for a quick prayer before disappearing beyond sight.</p>
